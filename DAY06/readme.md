# ðŸ’¯ 100 Days of LeetCode â€“ Java Edition

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfCode** journey!  
This repository is a log of my commitment to solving at least one LeetCode problem every day for 100 days, using **Java**.

ðŸ§  The goal: Build strong foundations in **Data Structures & Algorithms** and prepare for coding interviews by solving problems daily and recognizing patterns.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Why I'm Doing This

- To build a consistent habit of coding
- To strengthen problem-solving and DSA knowledge
- To prepare for technical interviews
- To document and track my learning
